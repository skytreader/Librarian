This is just a test GitHub project for me. Trying to learn both CodeIgniter
and git.

I intend to use this personally and, as such, my branch of development will
not focus on things which an actual library might need such as keeping tab
on library members and borrowed books. For the most part, it is just an
interface to a book database I designed.
