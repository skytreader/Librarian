<p><strong>Librarian</strong> was created by <strong>Chad Estioco</strong>. This was built on PHP using the CodeIgniter framework. The database runs on MySQL while some of the JavaScript effects were achieved with the help of jQuery.</p>

<p>For the most part, Librarian is just an interface to a book database I designed. No one but me has a log-in account and, without a log-in account, the only thing a user can see is the search functionality. I personally and physically own all the books feautred in the database. Being that this is just an interface to a book database I designed, it does not have the usual functionality you would expect from a library manager like, say, keeping track of lent books (personally, I'm very picky when it comes to lending my books).</p>
